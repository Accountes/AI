Types of Artificial Intelligence:</font></strong></p></center>

Artificial Intelligence can be 
classified in several ways. The first classifies the AI as either weak 
AI or strong AI. Weak AI also known as narrow AI, is an AI system that 
is designed and trained for a specific type of task. Strong AI, also 
known as artificial general intelligence, is an AI system with 
generalized human cognitive abilities so that when presented with an 
unfamiliar task, it has enough intelligence to find a solution. 
The&nbsp turing Test</a>,
 developed by mathematician Alan Turing in 1950, is a method used to 
determine if a computer can think like a human, although the method is 
controversial. The second example is from Arend Hintze, an assistant 
professor of integrative biology and computer science and engineering at
 Michigan State University. He categorized AI into four types, and these
 were as follow:</font></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><font color="1B7814">
Type 1: Reactive Machines. An example is Deep Blue, an IBM chess 
program that can identify pieces on the chess board and can make 
predictions accordingly. But the major fault with this is that it has no
 memory and cannot use past experiences to inform future ones. It also 
analyzes possible moves of its own and its opponents. Deep Blue and 
AlphaGO were designed for narrow purposes and cannot easily be applied 
to any other situation.</font></li>
<li><font color="1B7814">
Type2: Limited Memory. These AI systems can use past experiences to 
inform future decisions. Most of the decision-making functions in the 
autonomous vehicles have been designed in this way.</font></li>
<li><font color="1B7814">
Type 3: Theory of mind: This is a psychology term, which refers to 
the understanding that the other have in their own beliefs and 
intentions that impact the decisions they make. At present this kind of 
artificial intelligence does not exist.</font></li>
<li><font color="1B7814">
Type4: Self-awareness. In this category, AI systems have a sense of 
self, have consciousness. Machines with self-awareness understand their 
current state and can use the information to infer what others are 
feeling. This type of AI does not yet exist.</font></li>
