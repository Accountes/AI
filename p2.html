 	<center><strong>Examples of AI technology</strong>
 	<br> 	<br>
 	<br>


  
 •	Automation. When paired with AI technologies, automation 
tools can expand the volume and types of tasks performed. An example is 
robotic process automation (RPA), a type of software that automates 
repetitive, rules-based data processing tasks traditionally done by 
humans.   <br><br>

When combined with machine learning and emerging AI tools, RPA 
can automate bigger portions of enterprise jobs, enabling RPA's tactical
 bots to pass along intelligence from AI and respond to process changes
 Machine learning.    <br><br>

 This is the science of getting a computer to 
act without programming. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning 
that, in very simple terms, can be thought of as the automation of 
predictive analytics.   <br><br>

• Robotics. This field of engineering focuses on the design and 
manufacturing of robots.  <br><br>

 •Robots are often used to perform tasks that are
 difficult for humans to perform or perform consistently. For example, 
robots are used in assembly lines for car production or by NASA to move 
large objects in space. 
Researchers are also using machine learning to 
build robots that can interact in social settings.  <br><br>

 •	Natural language processing. This is the processing of human 
language by a computer program. One of the older and  best-known 
examples of NLP is spam detection, which looks at the subject line and 
text of an email and decides if it's junk. Current approaches to NLP are
 based on machine learning. NLP tasks include text translation, 
sentiment analysis and speech recognition.
