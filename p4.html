 	<center><strong> Applications of AI 
</strong>
   <br><br>
 <h4> In healthcare. The biggest bets are on improving patient 
outcomes and reducing costs. Companies are applying machine learning to 
make better and faster AI diagnoses than humans. One of the best-known 
healthcare technologies is IBM Watson. It understands natural language 
and can respond to questions asked of it. The system mines patient data 
and other available data sources to form a hypothesis, which it then 
presents with a confidence scoring schema. Other AI applications include
 using online virtual health assistants and chatbots to help patients 
and healthcare customers find medical information, schedule 
appointments, understand the billing process and complete other 
administrative processes. An array of AI technologies is also being used
 to predict, fight and understand pandemics such as COVID-19.<br>
 AI in business. Machine learning algorithms are being integrated 
into analytics and customer relationship management (CRM) platforms to 
uncover information on how to better serve customers. Chatbots have been
 incorporated into websites to provide immediate service to customers. 
Automation of job positions has also become a talking point among 
academics and IT analysts.<br>
 AI in education. AI can automate grading, giving educators more 
time. It can assess students and adapt to their needs, helping them work
 at their own pace. AI tutors can provide additional support to 
students, ensuring they stay on track. And it could change where and how
 students learn, perhaps even replacing some teachers.<br>
 AI in finance. AI in personal finance applications, such as Intuit 
Mint or TurboTax, is disrupting financial institutions. Applications 
such as these collect personal data and provide financial advice. Other 
programs, such as IBM Watson, have been applied to the process of buying
 a home. Today, artificial intelligence software performs much of the 
trading on Wall Street.<br>
 AI in law. The discovery process -- sifting through documents -- in
 law is often overwhelming for humans. Using AI to help automate the 
legal industry's labor-intensive processes is saving time and improving 
client service. Law firms are using machine learning to describe data 
and predict outcomes, computer vision to classify and extract 
information from documents and natural language processing to interpret 
requests for information.<br>
 AI in manufacturing. Manufacturing has been at the forefront of 
incorporating robots into the workflow. For example, the industrial 
robots that were at one time programmed to perform single tasks and 
separated from human workers, increasingly function as cobots: Smaller, 
multitasking robots that collaborate with humans and take on 
responsibility for more parts of the job in warehouses, factory floors 
and other workspaces.<br>
 AI in banking. Banks are successfully employing chatbots to make 
their customers aware of services and offerings and to handle 
transactions that don't require human intervention. AI virtual 
assistants are being used to improve and cut the costs of compliance 
with banking regulations. Banking organizations are also using AI to 
improve their decision-making for loans, and to set credit limits and 
identify investment opportunities.<br>
 

 AI in transportation. In addition to AI's fundamental role in 
operating autonomous vehicles, AI technologies are used in 
transportation to manage traffic, predict flight delays, and make ocean 
shipping safer and more efficient.
